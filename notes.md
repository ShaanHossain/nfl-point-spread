We need to find a better way to initialize the team strength in the beginning.

- Offensive strenght is more accurate than defensive strength because you have a lot more offensive stats
- Consider using the percentage of players who left to weight how accurate the last season will be for predicitng the next season
- Pre season games are a bad predictor of future performance.

### Features we're curious about

- Standardizing the spacing between observations

### Future

- Analyzing teams individually per match
